# Flex

A Lean 4 library for a constraint-solving framework for Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs).

---

## Using as a Dependency

### Prerequisites

- [Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/quickstart.html) installed via `elan`

### Step 1 — Add to your `lakefile.toml`

```toml
[[require]]
name = "Flex"
git = "https://github.com/jam-khan/Flex"
rev = "main"
```

### Step 2 — Fetch the dependency

```bash
lake update
```

This clones the repo into `.lake/packages/Flex/` using your local Git credentials.

### Step 3 — Build

```bash
lake build
```

> **Note:** Flex depends on `aesop`, pinned `lean-auto`, and pinned `lean-smt`.
> Its modules do not import Mathlib, but the pinned lean-smt package declares
> Mathlib as a transitive dependency. `flex_auto` needs `z3` on `PATH`;
> lean-smt downloads its own cvc5 native library during the first build.
> `MATHLIB_NO_CACHE_ON_UPDATE=1 lake --keep-toolchain update` avoids fetching
> unused Mathlib build caches. The Lean toolchain remains `v4.29.0-rc8`.

## Importing

A single import gives you the core API, Lean tactics, and lean-auto wrapper:

```lean4
import Flex
```

This includes all core types, tactics, elaboration, and the solver.
For lean-smt, additionally import `Flex.Tactic.Oracles.Smt`.

### Example

```lean4
import Flex

def ex1 : Prop :=
  ∃ κ : Int → Prop,
    ∀ x : Int,
      0 ≤ x →
      (∀ ν : Int, ν = x - 1 → κ ν)
    ∧ (∀ y : Int, κ y →
        ∀ ν : Int, ν = y + 1 → 0 ≤ ν)
```

See the [`Demo/`](./Demo/Basic.lean) folder for more worked examples.
